## How to take zettelkasten notes 

`mkdir $(isosec)` creates a folder with current isosec then I have to change inside the 
directory and create README.md, I should create a simple bash script to at least do this automatically
when there are multiple folders it might be hard to find which dir was just created

#zettelkasten, #taking-notes
