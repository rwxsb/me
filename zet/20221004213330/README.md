>"One of the consequences of centralised governance is the tendency to standardise on single technology platforms.
>Experience shows that this approach is constricting - not every problem is a nail and not every solution a hammer.
>We prefer using the right tool for the job and while monolithic applications can take advantage of
>different languages to a certain extent, it isn't that common."
>- _Martin Fowler_
