## Bash scripting arguments

While trying to create my own zet script I named mine `note` I realized `#` makes everything after a comment even when specifying arguments.
`note -f #R` always told me that -f needs arguments, I was confused till I realized this, my plans to use these hashtag stuff for categorising is gone :(
I better find some better option.

#bash-script
