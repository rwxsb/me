## Continuous Reading
Beginning of the year 2023, I have decided to read more books, so far I have finished the 3rd month's book with a little delay however I realize that cramming a lot of reading in a day just to make it to deadline or setting a book to a certain month without considering its size isn't the best method on long term.

I hereby declare to read minimum 25 pages a day which makes 750 pages in a regular monthif the book is close to this number I will allow myself to finish it in that month.
