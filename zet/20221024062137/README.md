## Engineering Excellence 

Engineering excellence is the pursuit of being excellent at the craft of engineering, being both efficient as well as effective in delivering delight to customers and in the process deriving pride and satisfaction from the work and the finished product. It is an endeavor, not an end goal and it spurs us as engineers to wake up each day to just build better and become better at our craft.
